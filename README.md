# jbeewi is based on BeewiPy - thanks to the original developers.
I wanted to work on some personalised functions and parameters which haven't been added to Beewipy yet
so I've created my own mod, for fun and practice. The original README is attached.

Requires pygame, pyaudio, speech_recognition, sys
launch with argument 1 currently to make things simple (this is the interval for the light changing in random mode)

Press right to start listening (currently isn't a way to stop in this version :D)
voice commands:
on
off
random
stop
romantic

if you don't want to use voice commands, you can start the program with some arguments.

python jbeewi.py loop 0.5  (this will randomly change the colour every half a second)

python jbeewi.py pink (will set a pink hue)
